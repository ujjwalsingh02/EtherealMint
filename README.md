## Introduction

This README file provides instructions on how to run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git (optional, for cloning the project repository)
- Metamask installed in your computer

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine (if you haven't already done so):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ujjwalsingh02/EtherealMint.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd EtherealMint

3. Install project dependencies using npm:

   npm install

   This command installs all the required packages and dependencies specified in the package.json file. It ensures that your project has all the necessary tools and libraries to run successfully.

Running the Project
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project using the following command:

npm run dev


This command starts the development server and launches the project on your local machine. It typically opens a browser window with the project running at http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if specified).

Additional Note:

Make sure to have a stable internet connection during the installation process to download all required packages efficiently.
